This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when using functional components and hooks like `useState` within a conditional statement or before the component has fully mounted.

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  if (someCondition) {
    // Error! count might be undefined here
    console.log(count); 
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
