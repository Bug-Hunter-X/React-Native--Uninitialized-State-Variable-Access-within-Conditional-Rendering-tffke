This solution uses optional chaining to safely access the `count` variable. If `count` is undefined, it will return undefined without causing an error.

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  if (someCondition) {
    // Safe access using optional chaining
    console.log(count);
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Alternatively, you can provide a default value in the state initialization. This ensures that count is never undefined. 

```javascript
function MyComponent(){
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0) //count is initialized to 0 by default
  if (someCondition){
    console.log(count)
  }
  //..rest of the code
}
```
Another approach is to refactor conditional logic to ensure state is always accessed after initialization.
